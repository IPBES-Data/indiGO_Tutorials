# Tutorials for the indiGO R Package

This repository contains tutorials that demonstrate the usage of the he **indiGO (Indicators in Generalized Outputs)** R-package which is designed to analyze and display global indicators of the status and trends in nature in a generalized and systematic way. The indiGO package can be found in the [indiGO R package repository](https://github.com/IPBES-Data/indiGO).

## Overview

The indiGO R-package provides an open-access framework that enables users to access annually and globally aggregated indicators as described in the [first Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3831673) of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES, 2019). It follows the standardization of indicators outlined in the supplemental material of the Global Assessment Report, [Chapter 2.2: Status and Trends â€“ Nature](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3832005).

The package provides a flexible framework for handling a wide variety of indicators, not limited to a specific region, ecosystem, or time period. The generalized outputs are broad and adaptable, allowing users to apply them to various generalized data sets or indicator types across global or regional scales. Additionally, indiGO allows users to include their own data, enabling local data integration for customized indicator analysis.

-   **Available Indicators**: Lists all the indicators provided by the indiGO R package.
-   **Function Demonstrations**: Shows how the core functions of the package work, using practical examples.
-   **Plotting Figures**: Provides instructions and examples for visualizing the indicators using the package's functions.
